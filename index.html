<p>A solar eclipse happens when, at just the right moment, the Moon passes between the Sun and Earth. Sometimes the Moon only blocks part of the Sun's light. This is called a partial solar eclipse. Other times, the Moon blocks all of the Sun's lightSolar eclipses are fairly numerous, about 2 to 4 per year, but the area on the ground covered by totality is only about 50 miles wide. In any given location on Earth, a total eclipse happens only once every hundred years or so, though for selected locations they can occur as little as a few years apart..Solar Eclipse 2022 India Timing was on October 25 and the eclipse was for 7 Hours.</p>

     <p>Lunar eclipses occur at the full moon phase. When Earth is positioned precisely between the Moon and Sun, Earth's shadow falls upon the surface of the Moon, dimming it and sometimes turning the lunar surface a striking red over the course of a few hours. Each lunar eclipse is visible from half of Earth.There are three types of lunar eclipse: a total lunar eclipse, a penumbral lunar eclipse and a partial lunar eclipse. To understand the difference between them, we first need to understand how Earth's shadow works. As our planet blocks out the Sun's light, it actually casts two different shadows.A total lunar eclipse occurred on Tuesday, November 8, 2022. The southern limb of the Moon passed through the center of the Earth's shadow. It surpassed the previous eclipse as the longest total lunar eclipse visible from nearly all of North America since August 17, 1989, and until June 26, 2029.
